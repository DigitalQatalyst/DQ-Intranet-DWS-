Each section serves a specific purpose to ensure clarity, alignment, and operational effectiveness in managing remote work practices.\n\n## 1. Purpose and Scope\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the Work From Home (WFH) Guidelines is to provide structured and standardized processes for the implementation, approval, and management of remote work across DQ.\n\nThese guidelines aim to ensure that remote work practices promote accountability, productivity, and collaboration while maintaining operational efficiency, cultural alignment, and compliance with company standards.\n\n### Scope\n\nThese guidelines apply to all DQ Associates across.\n\nThey cover the end-to-end process of requesting, approving, monitoring, and reporting WFH arrangements to ensure transparency and consistency across all practices.\n\n## 2. Roles and Responsibilities\n\n**➜ Associate:**\n\n- Submit WFH requests at least 24 hours in advance via the HR Channel, clearly stating the reason and date(s).\n- Post daily action updates on the HR Channel and include relevant channel engagement links for visibility.\n- Remain active and visible on DQ Live24 throughout the workday.\n\n**➜ Line Manager:**\n\n- Review and provide pre-approval for WFH requests based on operational needs.\n- Monitor the associate's deliverables and ensure accountability for remote work outcomes.\n- Provide performance feedback where necessary and flag repeated non-compliance cases to HR.\n\n**➜ Human Resources (HR):**\n\n- Provide final approval for all WFH requests once Line Manager pre-approval is confirmed.\n- Ensure requests align with company policy and maintain consistency across departments.\n\n**➜ HR & Administration (HRA):**\n\n- Oversee overall compliance and adherence to WFH guidelines.\n\n## 3. Guiding Principles and Controls\n\n### Work From Home Guiding Principles\n\n**➜ Transparency:**\n\nEnsure all WFH activities, updates, and deliverables are visible to Line Managers, HR, and relevant teams to maintain operational clarity.\n\n**➜ Accountability:**\n\nAssociates remain responsible for meeting deliverables, timelines, and communication expectations while working remotely.\n\n**➜ Equity and Fairness:**\n\nWFH approvals are granted objectively, based on role suitability, performance, and business continuity requirements.\n\n**➜ Compliance and Discipline:**\n\nAdhere strictly to WFH policies, timelines, and approval workflows to maintain order and consistency across departments.\n\n**➜ Collaboration and Communication:**\n\nPromote open communication and team engagement through consistent updates and use of approved DQ collaboration tools.\n\n**➜ Data Security and Confidentiality:**\n\nSafeguard company data and maintain information security standards when handling sensitive or operational material remotely.\n\n## 4. Processes\n\n### WFH Processes\n\n**➜ Submit request:**\n\nAssociate submits WFH request at least 24 hours in advance via the HR Channel, including reason, date(s) and expected working hours.\n\n**➜ Line Manager pre-approval:**\n\nLine Manager reviews impact on workload and team coverage and provides pre-approval or requests modifications.\n\n**➜ HR final approval:**\n\nHR verifies policy compliance, gives final approval, and records the decision in the HR tracker. HR notifies the Associate and Line Manager.\n\n**➜ Post the day plan:**\n\nOn the approved WFH day, the Associate creates a thread in the HR Channel before work starts, posting actions for the day and channel engagement links.\n\n**➜ Clock-in & presence:**\n\nAssociate clocks in on DQ Shifts at start time and remains active/visible on DQ Live24 during working hours.\n\n**➜ Work execution & communication:**\n\nFollow the posted day plan, provide regular brief updates in the thread (e.g., morning, mid-day, end-of-day), answer messages promptly, and join scheduled calls.\n\n**➜ Record deliverables:**\n\nAt day's end, Associate posts completed tasks, outstanding actions, and any blockers in the HR thread for visibility and handover.\n\n**➜ Monitoring & compliance:**\n\nHRA and Line Manager monitor adherence. Repeated non-compliance triggers formal review per policy.\n\n**➜ Escalation & follow-up:**\n\nFailure to post daily updates or remain active on DQ Live24 will be treated as an unpaid workday.\n\nNon-compliance may result in revocation of WFH privileges or performance review.\n\n**NB**\n\nKindly note that any adjustments or exceptions for lateness, whether while joining DQ Live or arriving at the office, must be approved by your Line Manager. This process ensures fairness and consistency across all associates.\n\n## 5.
