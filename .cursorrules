# File Persistence & Placement

Never write Markdown or temp files into /src, /api, /tests, /database.

All temporary, AI-generated, or WIP documents go to /workspace only.

/workspace is excluded from version control.

/docs contains only validated, final, permanent documentation.

Final docs must be moved from /workspace → /docs only after implementation is complete.

Only three files allowed in /docs root:

README.md, SETUP.md, CHANGELOG.md.

All additional documentation must reside under one of the approved subfolders:

/docs/architecture/

/docs/iam/

/docs/database/

/docs/guides/

/docs/configuration/

/docs/archive/

Never create new docs inside /docs root.

Cursor enforcement:

If generating any .md file that is not final → save to /workspace.

If updating an existing doc → modify in place under /docs.

If creating new final doc → place in the correct /docs/* subdirectory.

Never leave .tmp.md lingering
