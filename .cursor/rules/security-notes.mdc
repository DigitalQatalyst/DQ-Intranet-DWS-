# Security Notes

- Maintain `docs/security-notes.md` as a simple log for this branch.
- After security-relevant changes or discussions (auth, access control, data handling, secrets, dependencies), append a dated bullet:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD | area | short note (what/why/impact)`
- Areas: auth, access, data, deps, infra, other.
- Keep it brief; ASCII only; no personal data.
- If file missing, create it with header `# Security Notes`.
