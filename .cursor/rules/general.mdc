# General Coding Standards

## Code Quality

- **Write clean, readable code** - Code is read more often than written
- **Keep functions small and focused** - Single responsibility principle
- **Use meaningful names** - Names should clearly express intent
- **Avoid magic numbers** - Use named constants
- **Comment why, not what** - Code should be self-documenting
- **Remove dead code** - Don't leave commented-out code

## Consistency

- **Follow existing patterns** - Maintain consistency with the codebase
- **Use project conventions** - Stick to established naming and structure
- **Be consistent with formatting** - Use Prettier or similar
- **Follow TypeScript strict mode** - Leverage type safety

## Performance

- **Optimize when necessary** - Don't premature optimize, but be mindful
- **Use appropriate data structures** - Choose the right tool for the job
- **Avoid unnecessary re-renders** - Use React optimization techniques
- **Lazy load when appropriate** - Code split large bundles

## Security

- **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
- **Validate user input** - Don't trust client-side data
- **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
- **Sanitize user content** - Prevent XSS attacks
- **Follow authentication patterns** - Secure routes and APIs

## Git Practices

- **Write clear commit messages** - Describe what and why
- **Keep commits focused** - One logical change per commit
- **Use meaningful branch names** - Follow project conventions
- **Review code before committing** - Catch issues early

## Documentation

- **Document complex logic** - Explain non-obvious decisions
- **Keep README updated** - Document setup and usage
- **Document API changes** - Help other developers
- **Use JSDoc for public APIs** - Document function signatures

## Accessibility

- **Write semantic HTML** - Use proper elements
- **Ensure keyboard navigation** - All interactions should be keyboard accessible
- **Provide alt text** - Describe images meaningfully
- **Use ARIA attributes** - When semantic HTML isn't enough
- **Test with screen readers** - Verify accessibility

## Error Handling

- **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't let errors crash the app
- **Provide user feedback** - Users should know what happened
- **Log errors appropriately** - Help with debugging
- **Use error boundaries** - Catch React errors

## Testing

- **Write testable code** - Make testing easier
- **Test critical paths** - Focus on important functionality
- **Keep tests simple** - Easy to understand and maintain
- **Update tests with code** - Don't let tests get stale

## Dependencies

- **Keep dependencies updated** - Security and features
- **Avoid unnecessary dependencies** - Keep bundle size small
- **Use well-maintained packages** - Check activity and support
- **Document why dependencies are needed** - Help future developers

## Code Review

- **Review your own code first** - Catch obvious issues
- **Be open to feedback** - Code review is a learning opportunity
- **Provide constructive feedback** - Help improve code quality
- **Focus on code, not people** - Keep it professional
